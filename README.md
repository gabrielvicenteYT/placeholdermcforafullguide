Ok, so here's the thing. Minecraft is a voxel sandbox game, in which you can do *almost* anything, while before you could do a ton more. Over the years, Minecraft has begun to show *some* censorship, since it was bought out by Microsoft [in 2014](https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-purchases-minecraft/), and Microsoft is known for these shenanigans. Another thing to consider, is that both Java Edition *and* Bedrock Edition performance sucks, because of poorly optimized code. Java Edition has a ton of mods to improve performance, one such modpack that improves performance is [Simply Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop).
