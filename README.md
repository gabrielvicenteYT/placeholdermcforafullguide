# Full MC Cheating Guide
This is a general guide of Minecraft Java Edition, excluding a few obvious things. This list is currently 100% made by me, so contribute to the project! Descriptions for the things will be covered below, the full parts will be seperate, by links.

## Just started to play Minecraft?
### Skip this if you know this part
Ok, so here's the thing. Minecraft is a voxel sandbox game, in which you can do *almost* anything, while before you could do a ton more. Over the years, Minecraft has begun to show *some* censorship, since it was bought out by Microsoft [in 2014](https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-purchases-minecraft/), and Microsoft is known for these shenanigans. Another thing to consider, is that both Java Edition *and* Bedrock Edition performance sucks, because of poorly optimized code. Java Edition has a ton of mods to improve performance, one such modpack that improves performance is [Simply Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop).
## Hacked Clients
Choosing a Hacked Client (or possibly more than one) is essential, since more are less detectable than others. From checking videos of hacked clients to asking some known cheating community members their opinion, I've made a list of both free AND paid hacked clients:

Best hacked clients overall: Augustus and Eject (Both a bit more than 80 bucks lifetime).
Best affordable hacked clients: Ryu for Polar bypasses, Rise for Hypixel bypasses.
Best free hacked clients: LiquidBounce
