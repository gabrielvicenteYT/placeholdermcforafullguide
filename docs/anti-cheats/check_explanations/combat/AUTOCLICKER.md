## Explaining AutoClicker Checks
AutoClicker checks are essential to detect most cheaters. However, I am not here to tell you how to patch bypasses, I'm telling you how to bypass those checks.

#### Click Consistency 
- Description: Checks for unnaturally consistent clicking.

- How to bypass it: Use legit-ish (10 min - 16 max, for example) CPS values.

#### Click Speed 
- Description: Checks for rotations too fast to be legit.

- How to bypass it: Reduce rotation speed, to about 10 - 14.

#### Aim Accuracy 
- Description: Checks for click accuracy, aka click patterns that are too good to be legit.

- Types:
- Short Term (has to be very high accuracy to flag instantly)
- Medium Term (what most KillAuras flag)
- Long Term (way harder to bypass, but it is possible, just make the clicking patterns less accurate over time)

- How to bypass it: Try to make your AutoClicker / Kill Aura click less often and less consistently over time.

#### Click Inconsistency
- Description: Checks for overly inconsistent clicking.

- How to bypass it: Make sure that your CPS gap in the client you're using is not too high.
