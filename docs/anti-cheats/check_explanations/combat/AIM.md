## Explaining Aim Checks
Aim checks are essential to detect most cheaters. However, I am not here to tell you how to patch bypasses, I'm telling you how to bypass those checks.

#### Aim Consistency 
- Description: Checks for unnaturally consistent aim.

- How to bypass it: Use legit-ish (60 min - 100 max, for example) Rotation Speed values.

#### Aim Speed 
- Description: Checks for rotations too fast to be legit.

- How to bypass it: Reduce rotation speed, to about 30 - 60.

#### Aim Accuracy 
- Description: Checks for rotation accuracy, aka Aim Accuracy that is either too good or too bad to be legit.

- Types:
- Short Term (has to be very high accuracy to flag instantly)
- Medium Term (what most KillAuras flag)
- Long Term (way harder to bypass, but it is possible, just make the rotations less accurate over time)

- How to bypass it: Use RandomCenter and other methods such as using Predict (In LiquidBounce) at -0.5 min, 0.5 max.

But in a nutshell, those other methods fully simulate a player's aiming behavior, and are 100x better than RandomCenter, though you have to possibly spend years to make those methods work.

#### Aim Shakiness 
- Description: Checks for overly shaky aim.

- How to bypass it: Make sure that your RandomCenter / whatever is called on your hacked client is not too high.

#### Sensitivity / GCD Flaw exploit 
- Description: Checks for the aim GCD not matching the detected sensitivity for everything else.

- How to bypass it: Use a hacked client that has patched / fixed the bug.
