## Anti-Cheat Test Servers

Anti-Cheat Test Servers are vital both for cheating, AND for legit players. Server Owners *should* use anti-cheat test servers (along with a hacked client that bypasses practically everything), to choose an anti-cheat for their server-

#### Notes
- This test server has a really buggy implementation of some anti-cheats such as Vulcan and Incognito, so you might not flag what the anti-cheat should flag

- TreeAC | Only has an EU proxy, but has multiple anti-cheats. Has 2 servers, Main and Other. [Main: tree.ac], [Other: tree.ac:25566] Currently has: 2 NCP Versions (both old), Horizon, BAC, AAC (3 and 4), old Spartan versions, and an Ancient Matrix version (I forgot about some other anti-cheats)

- poke.sexy | Unknown proxy location, is LiquidBounce's official test server. Has some issues with connecting, and other multi-ac test servers are way better.

- Spartan Test Server | EU Proxy. It's the official test server of Spartan, powered by the owner himself, Vagdedes. To get an elytra, you have to contact him, but that shouldn't be hard. Very likely always has the latest bleeding-edge build. (IP: minecraft.vagdedes.com)


- Grim Test Server | NA Proxy. It's the abandoned official test server of Grim, having no support + an old version of Grim. Use this for testing old bypasses ONLY, since there are better alternatives that use the latest versions (AntiCheat-Test and Loyisa's Test Server), (IP: test.grim.ac). IT IS CURRENTLY WHITELISTED, DO NOT TRY TO JOIN.


- Karhu Test Server | EU (most likely) Proxy. It's the official test server of Karhu, and has the latest bleeding-edge builds. (IP: test.karhu.cc)


- GodsEye Test Server | NA Proxy. It's the official test server of GodsEye, a mostly unknown anti-cheat to the community. (IP: godseye.nort721.com). Note that most people said that it's private, though I can get in with ease.


- Reflex Test Server | EU Proxy. The official test server of Reflex, an "add-on" to NCP (IP: test.reflex.rip).


- AntiAura Test Server | NA Proxy. The official test server of AntiAura, an outdated anti-cheat (IP: endcraft.net).

- Polar Test Server | EU Proxy. The official test server of Polar, the most used anti-cheat at the moment. However, the test server is private. (IP: test.polar.top)


- Dream Client's Test Server | Unknown Proxy. A GodsEye test server created by Dream Client (IP: test.dreamclient.xyz) IT IS CURRENTLY DOWN, DON'T USE
