## Hacked Client Tierlist
Choosing the proper hacked client can be hard, but this tierlist is made to help people with that! It has both some of the most known clients, and the most obscure ones too (only the good obscure ones are put into the tierlist)

## LiquidBounce
LiquidBounce is one of the best free hacked clients, and I'd recommend it for new users. Either way, here are the ratings!
### Rating
- Bypasses: 7.5/10 (lack of new bypasses, but that's on the works already)
- Visuals: 7/10 (not enough customizability)
- Price: 10/10 (free & open-source)
- Safety: 9.9/10 (will very likely *always* be safe, but you know how that can change anytime)
- Ease of use: 9/10 (can't be perfect, but there's also LiquidLauncher, which is an official launcher for LiquidBounce; don't worry, it has full support for offline accounts!)

## Sigma Nextgen
Sigma Nextgen is a new free hacked client, and a so-called continuation of Sigma 5.0.
### Rating
- Bypasses: 8/10 (bypasses Polar and a ton of other anti-cheats, decently customizable)
- Visuals: 9/10 (would be 10/10 if it had the Classic design, and remakes of other hacked clients' HUDs)
- Price: 10/10 (free, but not open-source)
- Safety: 7/10 (not sure about it, seems safe from my testing doe)
- Ease of use: 3/10 (only works on HMCL, what the hell is with the installation process?!?)
