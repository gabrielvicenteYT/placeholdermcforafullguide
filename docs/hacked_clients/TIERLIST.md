## Hacked Client Tierlist
Choosing the proper hacked client can be hard, but this tierlist is made to help people with that! It has both some of the most known clients, and the most obscure ones too (only the good obscure ones are put into the tierlist)

## Rise
Rise is a decent paid client, though it wouldn't be my first choice for bypasses.
### Rating
- Bypasses: 6/10 (really good for Hypixel, BlocksMC, Vulcan, and Verus, but decent for everything else)
- Visuals: 8/10 (very good looking, but not customizable enough)
- Price: 6/10 (it is only about 30 bucks, but I think it's too much for the current bypasses)
- Safety: 9.9/10 (I personally know Alan, so I'm very much sure it is safe)
- Ease of use: 7/10 (You can run it in the Minecraft Launcher, however, it needs quite a few steps not to suddenly crash, and the alt manager is meh)

## LiquidBounce
LiquidBounce is one of the best free hacked clients, and I'd recommend it for new users. Either way, here are the ratings!
### Rating
- Bypasses: 7.5/10 (lack of new bypasses, but that's on the works already)
- Visuals: 7/10 (not enough customizability)
- Price: 10/10 (free & open-source)
- Safety: 9.9/10 (will very likely *always* be safe, but you know how that can change anytime)
- Ease of use: 9/10 (can't be perfect, but there's also LiquidLauncher, which is an official launcher for LiquidBounce; don't worry, it has full support for offline accounts!)

## Augustus
Augustus is one of the best paid clients; I'd recommend it mostly for advanced users, since it's very customizable.
### Rating
- Bypasses: 8.5/10 (very good bypasses, extremely customizable, and works on Polar just fine)
- Visuals: 7/10 (I like them very much, but most people don't, and they're not customizable enough)
- Price: 4/10 (it is 80 bucks, so yeah, very expensive, but I think it is worth it)
- Safety: 9/10 (developed by multiple reputable developers, very low risk of it being a virus)
- Ease of use: 7/10 (has its own dedicated launcher, which is called EletricLauncher, but it doesn't work on the Minecraft Launcher)

## Sigma Nextgen
Sigma Nextgen is a new free hacked client, and a so-called continuation of Sigma 5.0.
### Rating
- Bypasses: 8/10 (bypasses Polar and a ton of other anti-cheats, decently customizable)
- Visuals: 9/10 (would be 10/10 if it had the Classic design, and remakes of other hacked clients' HUDs)
- Price: 10/10 (free, but not open-source)
- Safety: 7/10 (not sure about it, seems safe from my testing though)
- Ease of use: 7/10 (You install it like how you do it with most cracked clients)
