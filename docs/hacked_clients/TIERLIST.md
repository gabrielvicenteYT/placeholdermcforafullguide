## Hacked Client Tierlist
Choosing the proper hacked client can be hard, but this tierlist is made to help people with that! It has both some of the most known clients, and the most obscure ones too (only the good obscure ones are put into the tierlist)

## Free Clients
### LiquidBounce
LiquidBounce is one of the best free hacked clients, and I'd recommend it for new users. Either way, here are the ratings!
#### Rating
- Bypasses: 7.5/10 (lack of new bypasses, but that's on the works already)
- Visuals: 7/10 (not enough customizability, minor accessibility issues)
- Price: 10/10 (free & open-source)
- Safety: 9.9/10 (will very likely *always* be safe, but you know how that can change anytime)
- Ease of use: 9/10 (can't be perfect, but there's also LiquidLauncher, which is an official launcher for LiquidBounce; don't worry, it has full support for offline accounts!)
#### Extra Features
- LiquidLauncher: 7/10 (decently good, however, you cannot install other clients onto it, which is sad)
- Scripting: 8/10 (generally very good, no big cons)

### Atani
Atani is a free and open-source hacked client, which is not very known; it is mainly developed by Kellohylly.
#### Rating
- Bypasses: 6/10 (bypasses anti-cheats decently)
- Visuals: 7/10 (has some good visual remakes, not much to say)
- Price: 10/10 (free & open-source)
- Safety: 9/10 (pretty sure it's safe, however, I cannot confirm)
- Ease of use: 6/10 (takes a long time to launch, works on the Minecraft Launcher)

### Tenacity Reborn
Tenacity Reborn is a free hacked client, and a continuation of Tenacity Reborn; it is made by me.
#### Rating
- Bypasses: 3/10 (really bad for Polar, although it might work for about 10 minutes)
- Visuals: 8/10 (working on more visual options, has good remakes of other clients' TargetHUDs)
- Price: 10/10 (free, source not disclosed yet)
- Safety: 9.9/10 (no malware in the source code, and I am decently trustable)
- Ease of use: 8/10 (works on the Minecraft Launcher, as easy to install as most free MCP clients, although some new dependencies exist for it to not crash)
#### Extra Features
- Scripting: 6/10 (amazing syntax, but not enough class access)

### Sigma Nextgen
Sigma Nextgen is a new free hacked client, and a so-called continuation of Sigma 5.0.
#### Rating
- Bypasses: 8/10 (bypasses Polar and a ton of other anti-cheats, decently customizable)
- Visuals: 9/10 (would be 10/10 if it had the Classic design, and remakes of other hacked clients' HUDs)
- Price: 10/10 (free, but not open-source)
- Safety: 7/10 (not sure about it, seems safe from my testing though)
- Ease of use: 7/10 (you install it like how you do it with most cracked clients)

## Paid Clients
### Rise
Rise is a decent paid client, though it wouldn't be my first choice for bypasses.
#### Rating
- Bypasses: 6/10 (really good for Hypixel, BlocksMC, Vulcan, and Verus, but decent for everything else)
- Visuals: 8/10 (very good looking, but not customizable enough)
- Price: 6/10 (it is only about 30 bucks, but I think it's too much for the current bypasses)
- Safety: 9.9/10 (I know Alan since about 2020, so I'm very much sure it is safe)
- Ease of use: 7/10 (you can run it in the Minecraft Launcher, however, it needs quite a few steps not to suddenly crash, and the alt manager is meh)
#### Extra Features
- Scripting: 7/10 (good syntax, however, it is not enough things to make really good modules)

### Moon
Moon is one of the best paid clients, it will give a good run for its money.
#### Rating
- Bypasses: 8/10 (really good, has a lot of bypasses)
- Visuals: 8/10 (stunning visuals, considering this is not a Figma project for best designers)
- Price: 8/10 (is 20 bucks, so, even cheaper than Rise; very worth it, in my opinion)
- Safety: 9.5/10 (made by multiple reputable members of the cheating community, has been around for 4 years)
- Ease of use: 7/10 (has its own launcher, not sure if it works in the Minecraft Launcher)
#### Extra Features
- Scripting: 8/10 (is very good, based on Lua)
- Launcher: 9/10 (absolutely stunning in terms of visuals)

### Augustus
Augustus is one of the best paid clients; I'd recommend it mostly for advanced users, since it's very customizable.
#### Rating
- Bypasses: 9/10 (very good bypasses, extremely customizable, and is somehow the only fully bypassing Polar client)
- Visuals: 8/10 (I like them very much, but most people don't, and they don't seem to have a lot of modes to recreate other clients' visuals)
- Price: 4/10 (it is 80 bucks, so yeah, very expensive, but I think it is worth it)
- Safety: 9/10 (developed by multiple reputable developers that also work in open-source projets, very low risk of it being a virus)
- Ease of use: 7/10 (has its own dedicated launcher, which is called EletricLauncher, but it doesn't work on the Minecraft Launcher)
#### Extra Features
- EletricLauncher: 7/10 (minimalistic launcher for Augustus, seems to be quite lightweight, but can't run other clients)

### Astolfo
Astolfo is a really good paid client, because of its amazing scripting API. However, it is not actively developed.
#### Rating
- Bypasses: 7/10 (still bypasses some anti-cheats)
- Visuals: 8/10 (old visuals were better; however, I still like these ones)
- Price: 6/10 (is 40 dollars, not the best)
- Safety: 9/10 (made by reputable developers)
- Ease of use: 6/10 (pretty sure it has a launcher, but I never saw it)
#### Extra Features
- Scripting: 9/10 (scripting API based on Lua, very good for what it is, though I'm not a fan of Lua's syntax)
- Launcher: ?/10 (don't know anything about it)
